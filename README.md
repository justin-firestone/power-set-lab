# power-set-lab

In this lab, you will generate the power set of a list of organizations you would like to visit during the career fair. There are 21 organizations to choose from. Some of the work is done for you already, such as the get_bit_array function. Your task is to complete the code stub for generating all of the possible combinations for the power set in the generate_all_subsets function and determine which subset is optimal in the career_fair_planner function.

Note how long it takes to generate 2^21 combinations. Add another company "V" and see how long it takes. Then add a company "W" and so on. How many companies can you try before it takes an intolerable amount of time?

Upload your Python file to Canvas and enter in a text box your runtime results.
